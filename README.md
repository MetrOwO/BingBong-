To do for logger.c:
  - [ ] Socket for sending Data
  - [ ] Porting for Linux, MacOs
  - [ ] make it stealth
  - [ ] If the buffer is full it calls a thread to fflush the values to the server
To do for inputSender.c:
  - [ ] Actually idk
  - [ ] Maybe something like a rubber ducky, but I'm not sure about that
