To do for logger.c:
  - [ ] Socket for sending Data (Almost done, I can Create a server and a client but I need time to undestand how threads and stuff like that works)
  - [ ] Porting for Linux, MacOs ()
  - [ ] make it stealth (Almost there for now)
  - [X] If the buffer is full it calls a thread to fflush the values to the server (Actually I decide to write the buffer in the file... also if the buffer is not full it saves the string)
To do for inputSender.c:
  - [ ] Actually idk
  - [ ] Maybe something like a rubber ducky, but I'm not sure about that
  - [ ] I will work on this late
